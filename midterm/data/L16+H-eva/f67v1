# Description:
#
#   The page contains only a circular diagram. At the center there is
#   a large sun with 18 narrow undulating rays (with two of them
#   joined; see below). The sun has a face with a short "frame" beard,
#   broad smile, crossed eyes, a skullcap. At the temples, two locks
#   of light wavy hair escape from under the cap.
#
#   There are 17 short titles radiating out of the center, towards the
#   diagram's outer frame (unit "Y"). Each of these radial titles
#   starts near the tip of a sun ray, except for the title at 02:00,
#   which is connected by thin wavy lines to the tips of two sun rays,
#   at 02:00 and 02:30. The text reads outwards, so it is upside down
#   from 06:30 through 11:30.
#
#   In each sector between consecutive radial titles there are from
#   one to four stars, 39 in total. Clockwise from the double sun ray,
#   the counts per sector are
#
#                     *                
#     *             * *     * *        
#     * *   * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
#     * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
#     3 2 1 2 2 2 2 3 4 2 2 3 3 2 2 2 2
#
#   Around the diagram there is a narrow band divided into segments, 6
#   at the top and 6 at the bottom. The band has wide gaps at left and
#   right, where it gets too near the margin. Each segment contains a
#   label enclosed in a decorative frame (unit "X"). 
#
# Comments:
#
#   The double ray may be where the stext starts. This guess is
#   supported by the line-initial EVA "p". (There is another "p" at
#   04:15 and an "f" at 06:30, but they are not line-initial.)
#
#   It is not certain that the labels in the outer band are
#   associated with the rays.  The gap on the left side is 
#   definitely empty, and that on the right appears to be so.
#   Thus there are only 12, or at most 14, labels in the band.
#
#   The decoration in the outer band includes 24 copies of the
#   "notched square" symbol, with double vertical edges.
