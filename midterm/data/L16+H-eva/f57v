# Description:
#
#   A circular diagram. 
#
#   Eight concentric mechanically drawn circles delimit four text
#   rings, which are divided into 4 quadrants by straight lines in
#   the NE, NW, SW, and SE directions. The lines are drawn with ruler,
#   but do not quite meet at the center (They may be modern additions
#   to the copy). there is an isolated word outside the outer circle.
#
#   At the center is a simple rosette, with 4 short and 4 long rounded
#   lobes, with a circle and a dot in the middle.
#
#   Inside the inner circle there are four naked human figures,
#   visible from the chest up, heads towards the center.
#   Two are male, two female; two are seen mostly from the front
#   two mostly from the back; two have both arms raised, two have 
#   only one.  Here are the combinations:
#
#     North:  male,   back,  two arms straight in "V".
#     West:   female, front, one arm straight at 45 degrees.
#     South:  female, back,  two arms straight in "V".
#     East:   male,   front, one arm forward then bent up, holding a ball.
#
#   There are 8 words inside the inner circle. Four of them radiate
#   from the rosette, roughly along the diagonal lines.  The other
#   four are tangential (but with straight baselines), to be read
#   in the clockwise direction; it is not clear whether they
#   label the four figures, or the spaces between them.
