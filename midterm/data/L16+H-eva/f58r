# Description:
#
#   The page contains three long text blocks with 14.5, 9.7, 15.7
#   lines, with clear gaps between them. There are hints of paragraph
#   breaks inside each block, but they are not evident. The three
#   paragraphs are left- and right-justified, except that the first
#   three lines are indented as if making space for an ornate capital.
#
#   There are three stars in the left margin, with 6, 7, and 7 points,
#   respectively. Each star is positioned just above the corresponding
#   paragraph. The last two starts have a small circular core.
