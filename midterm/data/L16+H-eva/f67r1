#   Quire I, first page.
#
#   This is the innermost recto panel of a four-panel fold-out.
#   There seems to be some confusion in the page numbering in this fold-out;
#   it is also listed as page 120.

#   Newbold plate III, Brumbaugh p66, both of whom call it f.67r

# Description:
#
#   The page is dominated by a circular diagram, surmounted by a single 
#   paragraph of text (4 lines).
#
#   The diagram is framed by three rings of text, delimited by 
#   four thin circles.  All three rings are broken at 11:30
#   by two radial strokes and a decorated design.
#
#   At the center of the diagram there is a cicle of small "pearls",
#   containing a woman's(?) face, with crossed eyes and a bored or
#   displeased look. The space between them is dark (hair? shadow?).
#
#   This small circle is surrounded by elongated triangular spikes, painted
#   solid dark, forming a 12-pointed star.  The gaps between consecutive
#   spikes are filled by kite-shaped regions, with the sharp corner pointing inward.
#   The result is another "fat" star with 12 chubby points and finely serrated outlines.
#   Each "kite" is split along its diagonal; the clockwise half is painted
#   solid dark, the other one is filled with little stars.  
#
#   The space between the "fat star" and the outer circle is divided into
#   24 sectors, containing alternately a label and one or two stars.
#   (The "star" sectors are those aligned with the starry half-kites.)
#
#   In the SE corner there is a mark resembling a "9" with "ng" superscript.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The central face probably represents the moon.
#
#   The mark in the SE corner is almost certainly the quire number,
#   "9th" in abbreviated Latin.
