# Description:
#
#   One plant, flush against the bottom and right margins of the page.
#
#     Root: single long root, consisting of six "telescoping" conical
#       segments, dark painted, with flat light-painted top.  Tip of root
#       is bent into a hook and ends with a small round knob.
#     Stem: long, straight, vertical, with a dark "shadow" stripe 
#       crudely painted along its length.
#     Branches: none.
#     Leaves: paired,  disk shaped with two "tails", two "arms", and a 
#       swallowtail-shaped "head", with long outward-curved tips. 
#       Stalks: medium length, thin.
#     Flowers: two, very unequal size, growing out of the tip of the stem.
#       Stalks: short, thin, like leaf stalks.  Calyx: heavy, swollen,
#       shaped like a sweet potato cut in half, dark painted.  Petals:
#       single row, light, semicircular, very small.  Core: flat,
#       light-colored, filled with dots; looks like a pepper shaker.
#
#   Two paragraphs (with 6.0 and 7.5 lines), both in the top half of
#   the page. The text is left-justified and follows the plant outline
#   on the right.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The plant looks quite strange. The telescoping root is hard to
#   explain. The leaf shape is unusual but not impossible. The bloated
#   flower chalices are very strange; they may have been drawn from
#   pressed and dried specimens.
