#   Plant: 12 (Petersen)
#
# Description:
#
#   One plant with no leaves and a single huge flower, spanning the
#   entire height and width of the page.
#
#     Root: a short, vertical, cylindrical stem that splits
#       into two almost horizontal mousetails.
#     Stem: straight, vertical.
#     Branches: none.
#     Leaves: none.
#     Flowers: a single flower at the tip of the stem.
#       Stalk: not visible, or indistinguishable from stem.
#       Chalyx: eight symmetrical sepals, shaped like long parabolas.
#       Corolla: four layers, of decreasing sizes, each having four 
#         symmetric petals, located diagonally with respect to 
#         the previous layer.  Core: none.
#
#   Two paragraphs (with 4.3 lines and 4.5 lines), both left- and
#   right-justified: one at the top, interrupted by the flower; one
#   just below mid-page, interrupted by the main stem.

# Comments:
#
#   Petersen has identified this plant with high confidence
#   as 
#
#     Nymphaea alba (white water lily, seerose)
#     http://www.lysator.liu.se/runeberg/nordflor/181.html
#     http://linnaeus.nrm.se/flora/di/nymphaea/nymph/nympcan2.jpg
#
#   There is indeed a good match in the shape and arrangement of the
#   petals and sepals. Also, the lack of leaves and branches in f7v is
#   plausibly explained by the fact that Nymphaea's flowers float on
#   the water's surface, and thus may have been hidden from the
#   artist's view.
#
#   But if f7v is Nymphaea alba, then what do we make of f2v?
