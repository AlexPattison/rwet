# Description:
#
#   A circular diagram defined by six faint mechanically drawn
#   concentric circles, forming three narrow bands. The two outer bands
#   each contain a ring of text, broken by a decorated section in each
#   band, at 10:00.
#
#   In the center there is an animal resembling a beardless goat,
#   light-colored, nibbling at a bush, standing on a scalloped (rocky ?)
#   ground. below it is a non-voynich word "ab*i*l".
#
#   In the space between the inner and middle bands there are 5
#   nymphs, and 10 more in the space between the middle and outer band.
#   Each nymph is standing inside an upright barrel, with a star or
#   flower next to her head. Some stars have tails (or stems); some nymphs
#   are holding their stars, by a ray or by the tail, others are
#   pointing at them, some have their both hands on the hips. All but one of
#   the nymphs are heavily dressed, and none have salient breasts or visible
#   nipples.
#
#   There is a label clockwise from each nymph.
#
# Comments
#
#   Presumably, the "notched square" devices at 10:30 may be the "start
#   here" mark of the circular text bands.
#
#   The goat is drawn better than the dark Aries (f70v1), and its legs
#   bend the right way, unlike those of the light Aries (f71r). The
#   nymphs (and the barrels), on the other and, are even worse than
#   those of dark Aries.
