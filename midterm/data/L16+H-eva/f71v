# Description:
#
#   Three concentric rings of text, bounded by faint mechanically drawn
#   circles. A wider gap in the outer ring at 10:30 may be the 
#   starting place.
#
#   In the centre is a horned animal feeding from a manger. Below the
#   bull is the word ``May'' in the Roman alphabet.
#
#   Between the inner ring of text and the middle ring are five human
#   figures or "nymphs", each standing in a barrel, waist deep,
#   holding a star. One is naked, four are clothed. The barrel at
#   00:00 is ribbed.
#
#   Between the middle ring and the outer ring are 10 human figures,
#   each in a barrel, waist deep, holding a star. Two are naked, eight
#   are clothed.
#
#   Most figures have visible breasts. Some have hats. All figures have
#   their right hand inside the barrel.
#
#   Clockwise from each figure there is a short label.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The animal at the center is probably a bull, the astrological
#   symbol for Taurus. Taurus is April 20th to May 20th.
#
#   The general appearance of the page is light, in contrast to the
#   dark Taurus, f72r1.
