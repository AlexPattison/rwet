#   Title: ???
#   Page: f70r2 = JD (Rene) = p132 (Stolfi)
#   Folio: f70

#
#   This page spans the two outer recto panels of a six-panel fold-out.
#   The outermost one (f70r3) is only half as wide as a normal panel.

# Description:
#
#   The first panel (f70r2 proper) contains a circular diagram framed
#   by four rings of text (unit "C") between two faint mechanically
#   drawn circles. There are two faint radial strokes at 10:00, breaking the two
#   outer rings, and one at 09:05, breaking the two inner rings.
#
#   The second (half-)panel contains a paragraph with 13.7 lines of text
#   (unit "P"), part of which spans the fold between the two panels.
#
#   Inside the diagram's frame is an eight-pointed flower (or chubby
#   star), with serrated outline. A narrow channel or stem connects
#   the tip of each of the star arms to the frame.
#
#   Inside the flower there is a sun, containing a ring of text (unit
#   "I"), and inside it a human (woman's?) face with crossed eyes and
#   smooth light hair. The sun has eight S-shaped rays directed along
#   the star's arms, interleaved with eight long spikes with a bulbous
#   base, each touchng the diagram's frame.
#
# Comments:
#
#   Speculation is that the two inner circles are one paragraph since
#   they share the single line marker at 09:05, and the two outermost
#   are another paragraph since they share the double line marker at
#   10:00.
#
#   However those lines may be modern guesses.  The aligned gaps 
#   at 12:00 on the two outer rings and at 06:00 on the two inner rings
#   are equally plausible.
