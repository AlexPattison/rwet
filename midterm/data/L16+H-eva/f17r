# Description:
#
#   One plant, flush against the right margin,
#   spanning from the bottom edge to a little below the top
#   margin.
#
#   Three paragraphs (with 2.6, 2.5, 5.5 lines) at the top, left- and
#   right-justified except for the last paragraph (which follows the
#   plant's outline on the right), extending down to mid-page.
#   Paragraph 3 may actually be two paragraphs (with 2.9 and 2.5
#   lines).
#   
#   There is one extra line of text above the top margin (unit
#   f17r.H), apparently not in the same hand as the rest of the page.
#   The letters are smalled than normal; some of them resemble
#   Voynichese charactersthey, others look more like Latin. One of the
#   legible characters is an EVA "y" with macron; another, less
#   legible, could be an EVA "r". The right half of the line is almost
#   completely erased, and may extend beyond the normal right margin;
#   the left half is not quite readable.
#  
# Comments:
#
#   The extra line of text at the top of the page looks similar to the
#   hand of f116v (especially the characters shaped like "l"s). The
#   letters are probably Latin, or possibly Greek; the EVA-"y" with macron
#   would then be an abbreviation.
#
#   The eyes in the roots seem to be the result of "enhancing" two
#   eye-like gaps in the roots.
