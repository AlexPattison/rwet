# Description:
#
#   The page contains only a circular diagram, framed by four faint
#   circles alternating with three bands of text (unit "C"). There is
#   a conspicuous extra-wide break in all three bands at 10:45. There
#   are also a couple of 'double space'd gaps in all three rings at
#   about 12:00, not quite aligned, following the first few words on
#   each ring.
#
#   In the middle of the diagram there is a colored disk filled with
#   tiny stars, with one large star at the center, whose slender rays
#   extend to the disk's perimeter.
#
#   Sprouting radially from the disk are 28 cylindrical objects
#   ("logs"), alternatingly long and short, extending about halfway to
#   the outer frame. Each log has a label (unit "L"), which reads
#   radially inward along the log's axis.
