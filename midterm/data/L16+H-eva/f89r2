#   This page comprises the two outermost recto panels (f89r2 and
#   f89r3) of a six-panel fold-out. Panel f89r3 is half-width. The
#   paragraph lines span both panels, across the fold.

# Description:
#
#   This page contains 4 rows of plants (roughly next to the top edge,
#   1/3 down, 2/3 down, and next to the bottom edge).
#
#   The plant rows contain 4, 2, 6, and 4 plants, respectively. Plant
#   [1,4] has a long tapering root that runs down the right margin and
#   ends near the bottom right corner (which is torn off). Crammed
#   into the left margin, next to each row of plants, is a
#   "container"---an object resembling a decorated jar with pedestal.
#
#   Each container and each plant (except plant [3,6]) has a "label"
#   written next to it (units "L1","L2", "L3", and "L4"). From the
#   position of the labels it seems pretty clear which label goes with
#   which figure.
#
#   The plant rows are separated by three paragraphs with 2.8, 3.6,
#   and 6.0 lines (units "P1", "P2", and "P3").  The first three lines
#   of aragraph 3 are indented as if to leave space for a capital letter,
#   but that space is occupied by the root of plant [3,1]
#
#   There is a faint vertical crease in the vellum, about 1cm to the
#   right of the fold that separates panels f89r2 and f89r3, and
#   extending across the whole height of the page. The third paragraph
#   (but not the other two) is crease, but runs over the fold as if it
#   was not there. The crease and the fold are more conspicuous on the
#   verso side (page f89v2).
#
#   In the second line of paragraph 2 there seems to be a slit-like
#   defect in the vellum, flanked by two alternating rows of dots.
#   This defect is visible on the verso side too.

# Comments:
#
#   [long root and leaves of [1,4] may match solatrium's; check!]
#
#   The vellum defect on paragraph 2 sems to be a slit in the vellum
#   that was at one time closed by sewing. If this interpretation is
#   correct, then the thread is gone, and the alternating dots are 
#   the stitch holes.
