# Description:
#
#   [To be checked and completed]
#
#   Six faint, mostly concentric, mechanically drawn circles delimit
#   three rings of text. At 09:30 there is a wider gap in the middle
#   ring and a radial stroke (a modern scribble on the copy?) cutting
#   across the outer ring.
#
#   Inside the inner circle is a beardless human figure, apparently
#   smiling, walking Westward. The figure (possibly, but not
#   necessarily male) is wearing a hat with round rim and a long veil
#   or plume falling down the back, to the waist. He also wears a
#   shirt with ring collar and broad sleeves, closed at the wrist; a
#   flaring skirt, with heavy pleats, down to knee level; and boots to
#   mid-leg.
#
#   The figure is holding an armed crossbow, pointing forward and down.
#
#   Between the figure's feet is an almost illegible word, possibly
#   "oct" in lowercase Latin alphabet (with a "t" resembling EVA "c")
#
#   Between the rings of text, there are two bands of naked figures
#   ("nymphs"), 10 in the inner one and 16 in the outer one. There 
#   are 4 additional nymphs standing on top of the outer ring of text.
#   Most of them are female (with breasts and shoulder-long hair).
#
#   Each nymph is holding or pointing to a star.
#
#   There is a label just clockwise of each nymph.
