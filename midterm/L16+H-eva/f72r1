# Description:
#
#   Three concentric rings of text, bounded by faint mechanically drawn
#   circles. There is no obvious starting place.
#
#   In the centre is a horned animal feeding from a manger. Below the
#   bull is the word ``May'' in the Roman alphabet.
#
#   Between the inner ring of text and the middle ring are 6 human
#   figures or "nymphs", each holding a star. Five are standing in a
#   barrel, waist deep; a sixth one is peeking from behind the barrel
#   at 08:30. All have the right hand inside the barrel, except for
#   the small one at 08:30 (right hand behind barrel) and the one at
#   02:00 (right hand resting on the barrel's edge). The figure inside
#   the 08:30 barrel is holding a smaller star, lower and closer to
#   her than the other figures.
#
#   Between the middle ring and the outer ring are 10 human figures,
#   standing.  The one at 00:00 is in frontal view, all others are 
#   in 3/4 view, between frontal and facing clockwise.  The one at 
#   02:30 has the right arm straight back and down; all the others
#   have the right hand on their hips.
#
#   All the figures are naked. Most have visible breasts. Some have
#   hats, some have long hair.
#
#   Clockwise from each figure there is a short label.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The general appearance of the page is dark, in contrast to the
#   light Taurus, f71v.
#
#   The animal at the center is probably a bull, the astrological
#   symbol for Taurus. Taurus is April 20th to May 20th.
#
#   [Stolfi] I count 16 nymphs in this page, but other people give the
#   total as 15. Presumably they are not counting the smaller nymph
#   without barrel.
#
#   It looks as if the artist decided to add one more figure at the
#   last minute, and had to improvise...
