#   Title: "Moon over Sun"
#   Page: f68r2 = IF (Rene) = p124 (Stolfi)

#   This is the second-innermost recto panel of an eight-panel fold-out.

#
# Description:
#
#   A circular diagram centered on the page, surmounted by a paragraph
#   with 5.0 lines (unit"P"). The bottom line is interrupted by the
#   diagram.
#
#   The diagram is framed by a large ring of 23 unlabeled stars. The
#   ring is divided into two arcs with 11 stars on the left, 12 on the
#   right.
#
#   The starry ring is filled with 36 stars of various sizes, all bigger
#   than the border stars, randomly placed. Of them, 24 (perhaps 25)
#   have a label (unit "S").
#
#   At the top, within the large circle, is a smaller circle with a
#   human face and moon-like shadow in the middle, and a ring of
#   Voynich text around the circumference (unit "U"). The moon has a human face
#   with neutral expression.
#
#   At the bottom, within the large circle, is a smaller circle with a
#   sun in the middle and a ring of Voynich text around the
#   circumference (unit "L"). The sun has a human face, with some hair
#   over the temple.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The two medallions presumably represent the Sun and Moon. Compare
#   this diagram with the previous one (f68r1), which is visible at
#   the left when the foldout is open.
