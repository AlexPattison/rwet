#   Title: "The Pleiades"
#   Page: f68r3 = IG (Rene) = p125 (Stolfi)
#   Folio: f68
#   Panels: f68r3 + f68r4
#   Bifolio: bI1 = f67+f68
#   Quire: I (Rene) = IX (Beinecke)
#
#   This page comprises the two outermost recto panels (f68r3 and f68r4) 
#   of an eight-panel fold-out.

# Attributes:

#   Subsets: A (Rene), cos (Stolfi)
#   Subject: astronomical
#   Colors: yellow(stars) (Reeds)
#
# Description:
#
#   A circular diagram, centerd on the page. The diagram is framed by
#   a band of text (unit "C1") between two faint mechanically drawn
#   circles, with no distinguished gap.
#
#   At the center there is a bored-looking round face, surrounded by a
#   band of text (unit "C2").
#
#   The space between the inner and outer bands is divided into eight
#   sectors by radial text lines---vertical, horizontal, and at 45
#   degrees (unit "R"). All lines read inward, so some are
#   upside-down.
#
#   Sectors 11:00, 02:00, 05:00, and 08:00 are filled with unnamed stars.
#
#   Sectors 10:00, 01:00, 04:00, and 07:00 contain respectively 1, 2,
#   3, and 4 stars, each with a label (unit "X"). Sector 10:00 contains
#   also a 7-star cluster, with a single label (line "X.1").
#
#   A curved line ("tail") connects the cluster to the moon at the center;
#   it too has a label (line "X.2").
#
# Comments:
#
#   The face probably represents the Moon. It seems to be a woman.
#
#   The seven-star cluster can only be the Pleiades. So perhaps
#   "doaro" means "Pleiades" in Voynichese?
