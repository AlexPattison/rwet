# Description:
#
#   The page contains only a circular diagram, framed by three faint
#   mechanically drawn circles and three rings of text (unit "C").
#
#   The first ring of text lies just inside circle #1 (the outermost
#   one). Only the top half of the ring is filled, and mostly with
#   dots and circles; the text proper is only a couple of words.
#
#   Text rings #2 and #3 lie just outside circles #2 and #3. There are
#   extra-wide word gaps at about 10:30, not aligned, and smaller but
#   aligned gaps at 01:30.
#
#   Inside the frame there is a textured and lightly-colored disk,
#   whose outline is broken by nine features with frilled edges that
#   resemble fat mushrooms, or squashed cauliflowers, or sea anemones
#   without tentacles, or... um... well....
#
#   Between the text frame and the "mushroom thing" there are nine
#   radial phrases (unit "Y"), each with two or three words, reading
#   inwards, starting near the frame and ending in the notch between
#   two consecutive "mushrooms".
#
#   At the center of the diagram there us a star with six slender arms,
#   inscribed in a circle with many short and rounded fingers.
#   Between the star arms there are six labels (unit "X"), reading inwards.
#
#   A faint straight radial line extends from the 10:30 arm and
#   bisects the corresponding mushroom (which happens to be the
#   smallest one).
#
#   Just outside the many-fingered disk there is a ring of text
#   (unit "I"). Its starting point seems to be the radial line at 10:30.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The starting point of the outer ring is probably at the aligned gaps
#   at 01:30, although the person who scribbled on the copy seemed
#   to prefer the non-aligned gaps at 10:30.
#
#   The starting point of the outer labels may be at 01:30 too, since
#   that label has a "p" gallows. Another possibility is the label at
#   10:30, just counterclockwise of the smalest "mushroom" (and of its
#   bisecting line).
#
#   John Grove thinks that the labels were written counter-clockwise
#   as those that are upside down are the ones between 6:00-1:00.
