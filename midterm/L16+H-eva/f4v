# Description:
#
#   One plant, mostly in the right half of the page.
#
#   Two paragraphs, both above mid-page. The first is left- and
#   right-justified; the second is left-justified, and follows the
#   plant's profile on the right.
#
# Comments:
#
#   Plant appearance: very, very odd, badly drawn. It seems to have
#   two types of leaves. The lower ones are too small, badly spaced
#   and badly proportioned, and in unnatural positions. The upper ones
#   look like pompons. The root has a strange, ungainly shape (but
#   that may be the work of the Dark Painter). The stems have uneven
#   and unnatural thickness.
#
#   This drawing is almost certainly an expanded version of plant
#   f101r1[1,5]. Stolfi suggested that the person who drew this page
#   thought that the star-shaped things in f101r1[1,5] were flowers,
#   so he supplied fantasy leaves; and he only noticed the mistake
#   halfway through the plant.
