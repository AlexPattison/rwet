# Description:
#
#   There is a mark at the SE corner, resembling a "7" (uncrossed, with
#   upturned serif on the top stroke) with a superscript "cg".
#
# Comments:
#
#   The mark at the SE corner is almost surely a quire number, a digit
#   with a Latin abbreviation. 
#
#   Landini's comments say "gathering mark 5". But it looks more 
#   like a "seven" to me...
