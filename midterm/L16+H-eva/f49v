# Description:
#
#   One plant, flush against the right edge of the page,
#   spanning it vertically from edge t edge.
#   
#   The top 3/4 of the page are occupied by three paragraphs of text
#   (with 13.0, 3.5, 8.5 lines), flush against the top and left
#   margins. The first paragraph is even on the left margin, and
#   follows the plant outline on the right. The other two span
#   margin-to-margin and are interupted by the plant's stem.
#
#   To the left of each text line there is a single symbol, 26 in
#   total, most of them being Voynich letters. Further to the left of
#   this column of symbols, on lines 2 thru 6 only, there are ordinary
#   numerals "1" thru "5".

#
#   Jim Reeds [03 Mar 1998] noted that the digits in the NW corner
#   seem to be in the same hand as the folio numbers.
