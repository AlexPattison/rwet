#   This page comprises the two outermost verso panels (f89v3 and
#   f89v2) of a six-panel fold-out. Panel f89v3 has half-width. The
#   paragraph lines span both panels, across the fold.

# Description:
#
#   This page contains 3 rows of plants (next to the top edge,
#   across the middle, and next to the bottom edge), separated by
#   two blocks of text.
#
#   The plant rows contain 5, 3, and 4 plants, respectively. Crammed
#   into the left margin, next to each row of plants, is a
#   "container"---an object resembling a decorated jar with pedestal.
#   Each container and each plant has a "label" written next to it
#   (units "L1","L2", and "L3"). From the position of the labels it seems
#   pretty clear which label goes with which figure.
#
#   The first block of text (unit "P1") consists of a single paragraph
#   with 3.6 lines. The second block (unit "P2") contains two
#   paragraphs, both with 3.8 lines.
#
#   There is a vertical crease in the vellum, about 1cm to the left of
#   the fold that separates panels f89v3 and f89v2. The crease extends
#   from the second line of the top paragraph down to the bottom edge
#   of the page. Eacept for the first line of the first paragraph, the
#   text carefully avoids that (clean and undamaged) crease, but runs
#   over the (dirty and worn-out) fold as if it was not there.
#   The crease has a similar effect on the recto side (page f89r2).
#
#   Near plant [2,3] there seems to be a slit-like defect in the
#   vellum, flanked by two alternating rows of dots. This defect is
#   visible on the verso side too.

# Comments:
#
#   [some drawings repeated in herbal]
#
#   [label "odor" from f101v2 mentioned here.]
#
#   From the layout of the text relative to the crease and fold, it
#   looks as if the crease was a defect of the vellum, already present
#   when the page was written; but the fold was neither present nor
#   explicitly planned for.
