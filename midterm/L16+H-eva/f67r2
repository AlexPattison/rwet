# Description:
#
#   A circular diagram, defined by 7 concentric mechanically drawn
#   circles.
#
#   Circles 1 and 2 (from the outside in) define a narrow band of
#   decoration, consisting of 24 copies of a "scroll"-like or
#   "resistor"-like object. Circles 3 and 4 define another narrow
#   empty band; same for circles 6 and 7.
#
#   Between circles 2 and 3 there is a band of coloured (red?) text,
#   consisting of 12 phrases separated by wide gaps (unit "Y"). They
#   don't line up perfectly with inner sectors (see below), but appear
#   to be spaced as if the intent was there.
#
#   Between circles 4 and 5 there is a broad band, divided into 12
#   sectors by straight radial lines, unevenly spaced. Each sector
#   contains two or three lines of text, reading clockwise, with straight
#   or curved baselines (unit "C").  
#
#   Near the bottom (innner) edge of each sector there is a round moon
#   with crescent shadow and human face. Seven of the moons have a
#   label just above (i.e. outwards of) them (unit "L").
#
#   This table shows the number of lines in units "C" and "L" and the
#   moon colours (light/medium/dark), starting from 08:30:
#
#     O'clock   08: 09: 10: 11:   00: 01: 02: 03:   04: 05: 06: 07: (+:30)

#     colours   lt  dk  lt  dk    md  dk  lt  lt    dk  dk  lt  dk 
#
#   Between circles 5 and 6 there is a single row of text, containing 12
#   labels (unit "X"), apparently associated with the sectors and/or
#   moons in the band above.
#
#   Inside circle 7 there is another ring of text, with 8 erratically spaced
#   labels (unit "Z").
#
#   At the center of the diagram there is an eight-pointed star/flower
#   with an "orange slice" background.  The eight arms are not
#   particularly aligned with the 8 labels of the innermost text circle.
#   The star arm at 08:30 has a dotted tail extending out between two
#   labels.
#
#   Below the diagram there is a normal-looking paragraph (unit "P")
#   with 3.0 lines. According to John Grove these are only lines in
#   the MS that are ruled.  The center line of text is coloured (red?)
#   and its strokes seem to be heavier than those of the other two.
#
# Comments:
#
#   It is possible that the text in all the sectors between radial
#   lines 10:00 and 5:00 comprises a single paragraph with three and a
#   half lines. The same can be said of the remaining sectors.
#
#   Robert Firth once suggested that the seven named moons may be the
#   the seven Ptolemaic planets.
#
#   Since line 2 of the paragraph is colored, each line is probably
#   a separate sentence.
