# Description:
#
#   Gathering mark 14.
#
#   Text and drawing take up most of the page, right up to the 
#   edges, except for some white space left in the middle.
#
#   Four tapering, densely decorated "biological" structures
#   grow from the four corners of the page towards the center.
#
#   Between these structures there are four paragraphs of normal-looking text.
#   right next to the respective edge, to be read clockwise.
#   In the rectangular area bounded by them, there are two more
#   paragraphs, interrupted by part of the Northwest structure.
#
#   At the very center of the page, below the two extra paragraphs, there is
#   a mechanically drawn "T-O map"---a circle cut into three sectors
#   by a diameter (from 09:30 to 03:30) and a perpendicular radius (at 00:30).
#
#   At the left of the T-O map, and partly over it, there is a faint
#   irregular (pencil?) scribble, mostly illegible, resembling a young
#   child's scrawl. With some imagination, the first row can be read as
#   two EVA <l> (larger than normal), a latin "n" with acute accent, and
#   a latin "F"; below them is an EVA <s>, with very dark <c> and
#   lighter plume. But none of these readings can be considered
#   significant.
#
#   In the structure descriptions that follow, "up" means towards
#   the center of the page, "down" means towards its corner, 
#   "left" is clockwise and "right" is counter-clockwise.
#
#   The Northeast structure looks like a chalyx with thick stem, covered
#   with rounded, upward-pointing scales (or close-packed leaves). From
#   its hollow there comes forth a converging bundle of lines, like a
#   strong water jet (or a bundle of stalks). Halfway though the "jet"
#   but in front of it there is a bird with outspread wings. The "jet"
#   ends bruptly after a short distance, to be replaced by a dotted band
#   (dust? droplets? seeds?).
#
#   The Southeast structure has the shape of a light bulb, with the
#   narrow end pointing up . The base (wider end) is wrapped in a
#   leaf-like chalyx. The bulb is decorated with several bands of knobs,
#   hatchings, and upwards-growing scales. The narrow end (nearest to
#   the center of the page) ends in a hole with dotted lip. Coming out
#   from the hole we see the head of another bird, with its ouspread
#   wings partly visible, and three curved "stalks" carrying three
#   corncob-like objects.
#
#   The Southwest structure has a base that looks like a flattened
#   flower, whose petals are made of thick riveted metal plate. On top
#   of that "flower" there are three similar "stages", each smaller than
#   the previous one. Each "stage" looks like a ribbed stalk, short and
#   broad, ending with a multilobed sleeve which holds a heap of round
#   objects with dots at their centers. From the third stage there grows
#   a short "jet" (or a fourth ribbed stalk) that opens out into a 
#   funnel or corolla with serrated borders.  The right half of this 
#   funnel is dotted.
#
#   The Northwest structure looks like a wide and short cylindrical base
#   with a band of scales or flaps around its top part, pointing down.
#   On top of this base is a short conical dome covered with scales or
#   leaves. Each scale has a dot. From the very tip of the dome there
#   sprouts a divergent bundle of lines that ends with a cloud of dots,
#   like a water jet.
#
#   Behind the Northwest structure there is a human figure with light
#   long hair, probably a woman. Only her head and hand are visible,
#   just to the right of the "water jet".
#
#   Behind the Southwest structure there is another human figure with
#   short dark hair, probably a man. Only his right arm, part of his
#   breast, and half of his face are visible, on the left side of the
#   structure.
#
#   The man's right hand seems to be holding a short tube, pointed
#   towards the woman. Issuing from it is a short jet of dots that ends
#   abruptly after a couple of feet. (The man may also be throwing
#   things at the woman, and the "tube" could then be the motion traces.)
#   The woman seems to be waving at the man.
