# Description:
#
#   One plant centered on page.
#
#     Root: left-right symmetrical, planar, looking sort of like 
#       headless stick man with outstretched arms and gripping hands.
#       Overpainted with dark color.
#     Stem: short and thin.
#     Branches: two main ones, almost upright, slightly bent.
#       Irregular thickness, awkward shape (cf. top right leaf).
#       Light-clored with a dark vein grossly painted along the middle.
#     Leaves: Dark overpaint, shaped like a triangular fan with five
#       lanceolated fingers. Stalk: medium length, looks like a branch.
#     Flowers: three, on tip of main branch.
#       Stalk: longish, looks like a branch.  Chalyx: an oblong oval
#       sweelling at end of stalk, partial dark overpaint.  Petals: many,
#       narrow and long; the flower looks like a shaving brush.  Core:
#       hidden by petals.
#
#   Two paragraphs (with 6.4 and 5.4 lines), left- and rightjustified:
#   one at the top, slightly narrower, interrupted by three flowers;
#   and one near the bottom, interrupted by two branches.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The root looks rather strange, the stems and leaves are 
#   somewhat awkward, but the flowers look normal.
#
#   Petersen tentative identification is "cyanus segetum, cornflower
#   (caeruleus) (cf 153)".  That must be
#
#     Centaurea_cyanus (cornflower,fiodaliso;bluet,kornblume)
#     http://www.lysator.liu.se/runeberg/nordflor/7.html
#
#   The flower shape and branching pattern seem to match fairly well.
#   However, those features are not very specific. [What about color?]
#   Also, the leaves of Centaurea cyanus are long and thin, with
#   smooth edges or a few very shallow teeth, attached directly to the
#   stem; quite unlike those of f2r.
#
#   Infusions of Centaurea cyanus were once used as a febrifugue 
#   (whole plant) and eye wash (flowers only).
