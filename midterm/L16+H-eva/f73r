# Description:
#
#   [To be checked and completed]
#
#   Six faint, mostly concentric, mechanically drawn circles delimit
#   three rings of text. There seem to be no distinguished break
#   in the text.
#
#   Inside the inner circle is a squat animal. A dark smudge
#   obliterates most of the animal's body, leaving visible only the
#   head (roundish, with a wide mouth and two very short and broad
#   horns) and the tail (that curves up, forward, down, then up
#   again). Above the animal is a seven-pointed star with a tail that
#   ends in the animal's mouth. 
#
#   Below the animal is an illegible word.
#
#   Between the rings of text, there are two bands of naked figures
#   ("nymphs"), 10 in the inner one and 16 in the outer one. Four
#   additional nymphs are standing on top of the outer ring of text.
#   Most of them are female (with breasts and shoulder-long hair).
#
#   Each nymph is holding or pointing to a star.
#
#   There is a label just clockwise of each nymph.
