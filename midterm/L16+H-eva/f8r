# Description:
#
#   One plant with a single, big, odd-shaped leaf and a "collar"
#   around its stem, horizontally centered and spanning the page 
#   vertically from edge to edge.
#
#   Three paragraphs (with 6.5, 3.6, 6.6 lines), left- and
#   right-justified and interrupted by the plant's stem, fill up the
#   bottom 3/4 of the page. Each paragraph is followed by a
#   right-justified two-word title.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The plant is very strange, bot for the leaf shape and for the 
#   "collar" around the stem.  Perhaps it is a mushroom (e.g. Amanita),
#   which the artist mistook for a plant and tried to draw as such?
#
#   The text format too is quite unusual, both in its length and in 
#   the presence of titles.
