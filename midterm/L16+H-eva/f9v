# Description:
#
#   One plant, flush against the right and bottom edges, reaching
#   almost to the top.
#
#     Root: a bundle of thin wires. Dark overpaint?
#     Stem: one straight. Light color.
#     Branches: two symmetrical pairs, oblique.
#     Leaves: the four lower ones are medium width, lance-shaped,
#       with smooth edges; the others have the same outline but
#       are deeply cut into five narrow points.  Dark color.
#       Stalk: short, mostly missing.
#     Flowers: five, at the tips of stem and branches.
#       Stalk: medium length, thin. Chalyx: flat or everted, with short
#       triangular sepals, partly hidden by corolla.  Petals: five rounded
#       petals, a large one on top, the others like "arms and legs". Core:
#       very small. Medium and dark colors.
#
#   Two paragraphs (with 3.7 and 7.7 lines) at the top,
#   left-justified. The first one is right-justified; the second one
#   follows the plant's profile on the right. Both are interrupted in
#   several places by the flowers and leaves.
#
# Comments:
#
#   Petersen identifies this plant, with high confidence, as "Viola
#   trinitalis".  I coudn't find such species, but "herba trinitatis" is
#   the herbalists' name for Viola tricolor (heartsease,wild pansy) [1,2,3].
#
#   Indeed, comparing f9v with a drawing by Carl Lindman [1], we see
#   an almost perfect match --- including the roots, and the two types
#   of leaves.
#
#   Dennis Mardle [10 Oct 1998] observes that the details match also
#   Viola arvensis (field pansy), which hybridises with V. tricolor
#   and is very similar in shape, including especially the dimorphic
#   leaves [1,4].
#
#   The colors may help resolve this issue. The flowers of Viola
#   tricolor are usually purple and white with yellow core; Lindman's
#   drawing shows V. arvensis as white (or light blue?) with yellow
#   core. Jim Reeds color list [03 Mar 1998] reports some blue on this
#   page, to be confirmed.
#
#   In either case, there is one odd detail: the flowers in f9v are
#   upside-down.  Also the two bottom flowers are somewhat differen.
#
#   Viola tricolor was used internally to treat epilepsy, asthma and
#   bronchitis (whole plant), as an emetic and purgative (seeds) and as
#   a heart tonic (flowers). Externally it was used to treat skin
#   diseases [2].  The flowers are reported to be edible.
