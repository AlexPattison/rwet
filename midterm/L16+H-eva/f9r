# Description:
#
#   One plant flush against the right margin, spanning the page
#   vertically edge to edge, with branches and roots that take up the
#   bottom 2/3 of the page.
#
#   Two paragraphs (with 5 and 3.9 lines), left- and right-justified.
#   Both are interrupted by the plant's flower head.
#
#   The second paragraph is followed by a centered title-like line
#   which may be the true last line of the paragraph.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The unusual shape of the leaves should make the plant easy to identify.
