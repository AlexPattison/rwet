# Description:
#
#   There is a marking at the SE corner, resembling a "6"
#   with a superscript "cg".
#
#   There seems to be a faint image to the left of the leftmost flower.
#   It is neither an imprint from f47v nor a bleedthrough from f48v.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The mark at the SE corner is almost certainly the quire number,
#   "6th" in abbreviated Latin.
