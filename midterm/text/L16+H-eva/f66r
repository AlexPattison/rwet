# Description:
#
#   The text is laid out in 3 columns. For each line:
#
#     The left-most column contains either a single Voynich ``word'' or is blank.
#     The middle column contains a single single ``character'' or a ligature.
#     The right column contains a line of what appears to be normal Voynich text.
#
#   The text on the right is laid out in paragraphs i.e. most lines are about the
#   same length, occasionally there is a shorter line (with blank space to the
#   right) followed by some vertical blank space before the next paragraph
#   starts.
#
#   In the top right hand corner there is a number "66" in ordinary numerals.
#
#   In the bottom left hand corner, there is a picture of a woman
#   lying down on her back (dead?). To the left of the woman are two
#   circles and a cylinder. Above her are four words in Voynich text.
#   To the far left are four words in a different hand and a different
#   alphabet. To me they look like:
#
#       v
#   Den  mv<illegible>
#      der
#
#   In the bottom right hand corner there is a symbol that looks like a number 2
#   on its side.
#
#   Here is a schematic layout of the text. Let
# 
#    L: left hand column
#    M: second column
#    R: right hand text
#    W: text above female figure
