#
# Description:
#
#   One plant, horizontally centered, reaching only 3/4 up the page.
#
#     Root: five unbranched roots, mostly horizontal.  Each root looks
#       like an earthworm, light-colored with a few dark dots, with a 
#       short and fat swelling about 4/5 of the way to the tip.
#     Stalk: straight, vertical, slightly tapered, uncolored(?).
#     Leaves: a single ring of large, lance shaped leaves, closely spaced, 
#       attached mid-stem with no stalks. The leaves curl down in a semicircle,
#       like an umbrella, until they almost touch the stem again; their thin
#       tips curl further into hooks. Dark overpaint.
#     Flowers: one, at tip of stem, pointing up. 
#       Stalk: medium, thin, uncolored(?); extension of stem.  Chalix:
#       thimble-shaped, partial dark overpaint.  Petals: long, hair like,
#       drooping.  Core: hemispherical, like a bubble.
#
#   Two paragraphs (with 3.6 and 2.5 lines), both above the plant,
#   left- and right-justified.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The plant looks very strange but not impossible.  The oddest
#   details are the position of the tubers, the shape and disposition of
#   the leaves, their curled tips, the "shaggy dog" flower.
