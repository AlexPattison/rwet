# Description:
#
#   One plant, mostly in the right half of the page.
#
#   Two paragraphs (with 3.8 and 8.6 lines), both above mid-page. The
#   first is left- and right-justified, and interrupted once by the
#   flowers; the second is left-justified and follows the plant's
#   outline on the right.
#
# Comments:
#
#   Plant appearance: very normal, exceptionally well-drawn. The layout
#   of leaves and flowers is very naturalistic.  The "dark painter"
#   apparently spared it.
