# Description:
#
#   A circular diagram with four smaller circular medallions touching
#   it at the NE, SE, SW and NW corners.
#
#   The main diagram is framed by a band delimited by two faint,
#   concentric, mechanically drawn circles, centered on the page. The
#   outer circle touches the vertical edges of the page.
#
#   Between these two circles there are four "captions", North, South,
#   East and West (text units "C1", "C2", "C3", and "C4",
#   respectively), each in two short lines, reading clockwise.
# 
#   In the center of the large diagram there is an irregular square,
#   within which is inscribed another circle, within which is a star
#   with 6 or 7 arms. The space between the star and the circle is
#   filled with "spiral galaxy" hatching, whose "arms" bend
#   counterclockwise-out. There are two words above the square
#   (unit "S1") and another two below it (unit "S2").
#
#   From the square, lines radiate out in the E, S, W, and N
#   directions. Each of these four lines is labeled (units "L1"
#   through "L4") and terminates with a branching structure.
#
#   Lines come in towards the square from the perimeter of the large
#   circle in the NW, NE, SE and SW direction. Each of these four
#   lines is labeled (units "L5" through "L8") and terminates with a
#   branching structure. Nested in these structures are two suns (NW
#   and SE) and two moons (NE and SW), all with faces.
#
#   The small circles in the corners contain between three and four
#   human faces, joined by lines. NE circle: four faces connected by a
#   cross, and one label (unit "F2"). SE circle: four faces, in "L"
#   pattern (with the second face centered on the vertical and wearing
#   a pointy hat), and one label (unit "F1"). SW circle: four faces at each
#   point of a square "U", on a coloured background; the two on the
#   bottom of the "U" are upside down. (John Grove speculates that
#   there is a fourth face hidden behind the first one on L5). NW
#   circle: three circular faces with one face on each point of a
#   reversed "4".
#
# Comments:
#
#   This is the folio Newbold claimed showed an annular eclipse. See
#   also John Manley's 1931 article in Speculum: ``Furthermore, I
#   invite the reader to examine carefully Plate IV and say whether it
#   bears any resemblance whatever to an annular eclipse.''
