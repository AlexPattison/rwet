# Description:
#
#   A large plant, flush against the right and bottom edges,
#   and reaching almost to the top margin.
#
#     Root: four dark teardrop-shaped tubers.
#     Stem: single, straight vertical, with dark streaks.
#     Branches: not visible.
#     Leaves: roundish, with scalloped margins.
#       Painted solid dark. Stalk: long and drooping.
#     Flowers: three open flowers and many buds, sprouting from two
#       sinuous, drooping branches; ome uncolored, most painted dark.
#       Stalk: short. Chalix: spherical, with a short trumpet
#       of fused sepals ending with a scalloped edge.  Petals: 
#       longish in the open flowers, resembling a diver's paddle foot with three 
#       fingers, painted dark; folded into the chalyx in 
#       the immature buds. Core, stamens, and pistils: not visible.
# 
#   Tunneling through the tubers are two animals that could be
#   snakes or earthworms: legless, with long, sinuous bodies
#   ending with a rounded tail.  Their head resembles that of 
#   a sea horse, and both have a row of dots along the back.
#
#   There are three paragraphs (with 3.0, 7.6, 9.6 lines).
#   The first one, squeezed above the plant, is left- and 
#   (roughly) right-justified.  The other two, that lie 
#   between 1/4 and 3/4 of the page's vertical extent, 
#   are left-justified, and follow the plant's outline at right.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The head and snout details of the snakes resemble those of the
#   "baby dragon" in f???.  There is a resemblance also to the fishes
#   in the Pisces symbol (f???) and the birds in the "Garden of Eden"
#   page (f???).
#
#   It is not clear how the "snakes" are related to the plant.
