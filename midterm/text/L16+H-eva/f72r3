# Identification:
#
#   Title: "Cancer"
#   Page: f72r3 = KE (Rene) = p139 (Stolfi)
#   Folio: f72
#   Panels: f72r3, f72r4
#   Bifolio: bK1 = f71+f72
#   Quire: K (Rene) = XI (Beinecke)
#
#   This page spans the two outermost recto panels of an eight-panel
#   fold-out. (The outermost panel is about 1/3 the width of a normal
#   one.)
#
# Attributes:
#
#   Language: ? (Currier)
#   Hand: ? (Currier)
#   Subsets: Z (Rene), zod (Stolfi)
#   Subject: zodiac
#   Colors: ??? (Reeds)
#
# Description:
#
#   (Beware that the scanned image is upside down.)
#
#   Four concentric rings of text (units "C1" through "C4", from
#   outside in), bounded by eight faint mechanically drawn circles,
#   roughly centered on the page. Circles 5 and 6 (from the outside)
#   are spaced apart almost twice as much as the other pairs. The
#   outermost text ring runs over the crease on the left side of the
#   panel, and into the diagram of f72r2; for that reason the text is
#   interrupted between 08:00 and 10:00. The middle ring of text has a
#   decorated "notched square" at 09:00, and the innermost text ring
#   has a wider word break at 08:55.
#
#   In the centre there is a pair of lobster-like creatures seen from
#   above. The one at the top is light-colored and facing East, the
#   bottom one is dark and facing West. Below them is a non-Voynichese
#   word, in a heavier hand than the other text in the page.
#
#   The rings of text delimit three circular bands, containing (from
#   outside in) respectively 12, 11, and 7 human figures or "nymphs",
#   i.e. 30 in total. There is a label just clockwise of each figure
#   (text units "Z", "Y", "X", from outside in).
#
#   Some figures are hardly visible due to the poor copy quality. All
#   figures seem to be naked, except for occasional headgear (hat,
#   bonnet, diadem, and one crown). They are standing (radially, with
#   the head outwards), in 3/4 view (between frontal and facing
#   clockwise). Some have visible breasts, some don't. Most are
#   holding a star with the right hand; the left hand is generally on
#   the hip. Some stars have "tails".
#
#   The following table summarizes the nymph and star attributes. Here
#   "cw" means clockwise, "ccw" counterclockwise. The "brst" column
#   says whether the figure has visible female breasts.

# Comments:
#
#   The two lobsters are probably a symbol for Cancer.
#   Cancer is July 7 to August 11 (?).
#
#   Note the switch from two bands of nymphs + overflow (as in f72r2)
#   to three bands of figures.
#
#   The decorated square suggests the text rings are to be read 
#   starting at 09:00 or so.
