# Description:
#
#   A circular diagram defined by three narrow concentric bands, each
#   delimited by two faint, mechanically drawn circles.
#
#   The innermost band is quite narrow, and empty. The middle and
#   outer bands contain each a ring of text, reading clockwise. The
#   text in the middle band (unit "R1") has a slightly wider word gap
#   at 06:00, and is interrupted at 08:30 by a black irregular spot.
#   (The same spot appears on the facing page f71r, quod videt.) The
#   text in the outer band (unit "R2") has a noticeably wider word gap
#   at 03:45. Both rings are penetrated at 10:30 by "stars"---see
#   below).
#
#   Inside the innermost band is a four-legged, hoofed animal
#   resembling a beardless goat. The animal has short fur
#   (dark-colored), sharp horns that curve packwards, and a short and
#   chubby tail. It also seems to have a crest of short hairs running
#   along the spine, from head to tip of tail.
#
#   The animal is nibbling at a bush, standing on a scalloped (rocky?)
#   ground. Below the animal's belly is a non-Voynichese word.
#
#   In the broad space between the ouer and middle bands there are 10
#   human figures, or "nymphs"; and 5 more in the space between the
#   middle and inner bands---or 15 nymphs in total. Each nymph is
#   standing (radially, with the head outwards) in frontal view, or
#   slightly turned towards the corresponding "star" (see below). All
#   nymphs look female; most have prominent breasts, and the two
#   exceptions (in frontal view) are rather poorly drawn, so the lack
#   of breasts is not conclusive.
#
#   Some of the nymphs are dressed, but the nipples and body outline
#   often show threough the dress. Most nymphs, even naked ones, wear
#   some kind of headgear (hat, veil, diadem, etc.)
#
#   Every nymph is standing inside an upright cylindrical container or
#   "barrel". In proportion to the nymph, the barrel is about two feet
#   wide, and has a "lip" a couple of inches wide. It usually reaches
#   up to the nymph's pelvis---sometimes bit lower, sometimes up to
#   her chest. Most of the barrels are decorated with distinctive
#   patterns of bars, dots, hatchings, circles, scales, etc.; but two
#   barrels have only a ring of dots, near the top edge, and three are
#   undecorated. The base of the barrel is hidden by the text band.
#
#   Each nymph has a star or flower by her head; usually on the
#   clockwise side, with four exceptions (inner 00:00, 02:30, 05:00,
#   and outer 03:30). Some stars have wire-like tails or stems. The
#   star at 10:30 in the inner band has a thicker, distinctive tail,
#   like a banded snake. Moreover, the two stars at 10:30 (inner and
#   outer) intrude slightly into the surrounding text ring.
#
#   Some nymphs are holding their stars (by a ray or by the tail);
#   others are pointing at them; and some have both hands on the hips,
#   usually hidden by the barrel.
#
#   Between every two nymphs there is a one- or two-word label (units
#   "S1" and "S2"), reading clockwise. From the spacing, it would seem
#   that every label refers to the preceding nymph, going clockwise.
#
#   The following table summarizes the nymph and star attributes. The
#   "spos" column gives the position of the star relative to the
#   nymph: "cw" if clockwise, "ccw" if counterclockwise. The "deco"
#   column tells whether the barrel has "full" decoration, or just a
#   ring of "dots", or "no" decoration at all. The "dres" and "brst"
#   columns say whether the nymph is dressed and has visible female
#   breasts, respectively. The "hold" column says whether the nymph is
#   holding the star (by a ray, or by the tail if present).

#    
#   There is a mark "10^{mg}" at the lower right corner of the page. 
#   It is certainly a gathering mark (quire number), "10th" in
#   abbreviated Latin.
#
# Comments:
#
#   STYLE AND LAYOUT
#
#   The ram/goat is drawn very skillfully and looks quite realistic,
#   except that the way its front legs bend looks wrong. (But I am 
#   a city boy, what do I know...)
#
#   The barrels are drawn rather poorly: better than those of f71r
#   (Aries light) but worse than those of f70v2 (Pisces). The width
#   and height are quite variable. The perspective is minimally
#   correct, but the top of the barrel is tilted at varying angles
#   relative to the observer, from near edge-on (outer 08:00) to
#   almost face-on (inner 02:30). In three cases (outer 02:45 and
#   03:45, inner 08:00) the top is rendered as an eye, not an ellipse.
#   
#   The pattern on the inner barrel at 00:00 is rather peculiar.
#   Unlike the other patterns it is neither symmetric nor repeating;
#   it looks rather like a cubist painting. It looks as if the barrel
#   is made of glass, so that the nymph's legs and hands are showing
#   through. (Perhaps the pattern was drawn to hide a mistake, or 
#   an artistic failure?)
#
#   THE CENTRAL EMBLEM
#
#   The central figure is widely believed to be a symbol of the sign
#   Aries. The word below the animal could be "ab**il" in the Latin
#   alphabet. It is traditionally read as some variant of the month
#   name "April". Aries goes from ??? to ???.
# 
#   THE TEXT RINGS
#
#   There is no obvious starting place for the text rings. The wider
#   breaks at 04:00 (outer) and 06:00 (inner) are not aligned, and do
#   not seem to be natural choices for starting the text. The binding
#   gutter at 03:00 is not it either, as the text was visibly squeezed
#   to fit in that part of the ring. 
#
#   The most likely starting places, IMHO, are the places at 10:45
#   where the stars intrude into the text bands. Note that the inner
#   star has the special striped "tail", and the outer star is being
#   held high up by the nymph. (However, the first star enters just
#   before a "daiin", and the second one under a word; so there is
#   reason to doubt.)
#
#   THE NYMPHS
#
#   Either the dresses are meant to be transparent, or they were added
#   later, in an attempt to mask the naked bodies.
#
#   THE LABELS
#
#   The outer label at 08:30 (<f70v1.S1.9;U>) reads "otshshdy" in standard EVA.
#   The two "sh" have quite different plumes---the first one is a closed
#   drop-like loop, the second is a open hook.
