# Description:
#  
#   The page contains two blocks of text, surrounded and separated by 
#   three figures.
#
#   The upper block of text contains a single paragraph (text unit
#   "P1") with 8.8 lines, justified top and left; its right side is
#   defined by an illustration. Another part of the same illustration
#   also interrupts the first 5 lines down the middle. The lower block
#   contains two paragraphs with 8.0 and 13.5 lines, separated by a
#   right-justified half-line of text (a "title"). The block is
#   justified on the left, its right boundary is irregular and partly
#   defined by the figure.
#
#   The top figure consists of two nymphs, near the NW and NE of the
#   page; a "vessel" in the middle; and tubes connecting these three
#   elements across the top margin of the page. The NW nymph has a
#   diadem and is standing inside "cup", which is decorated with rings
#   of dots, knobs, and hoops, and tapers down to nothing. The nymph
#   has her hand inside an arched tube that ends in the "central
#   vessel", shose shape is similar to the nymph's "cup". The NE nymph
#   is standing inside a large, smooth tube, that bends to the rigth
#   and exits the page. It too has her hand inside an arched tube that
#   ends in the "central vessel".
