# Description:
#
#   One plant, spanning top to bottom, slightly offset to the left.
#
#   Two paragraphs (with 10.1 and 5.3 lines), left- and
#   right-justified: one next to the top margin, one next to the
#   bottom margin, both interrupted by the plant.
#
#   There is a mark in the SE corner, resembling "^pm9" ("^" over the "p"),
#   with thick strokes.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The mark in the SE corner is almost surely the quire number,
#   "1st" in abbreviated Latin.
