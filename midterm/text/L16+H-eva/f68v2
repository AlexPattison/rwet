# Description:
#
#   The page contains a circular diagram, under a paragraph 
#   with 5.0 lines (unit "P").  The last line is interrupted
#   by the diagram.
#
#   The diagram is framed by a circular band of text (unit "C"),
#   between two concentric mechanically drawn thin circles. (An
#   extra-wide gap at 10:30 may be the starting point.)
#
#   At the center there is a figure that looks pretty much like a
#   flower, with eight almond-shaped petals. The petals have serrated
#   edges, and overlap randomly. (However some pairs of petals seem to
#   be fused.)  The petals have been painted in a dark color.
#
#   At the very center of this "flower" there is an irregular star,
#   with twisted rays, in a different color.
#
#   The "flower"'s outline ia an eight-sided star, resembling two
#   concentric squares rotated 45 degrees apart.  From the tips
#   of each "petal", there sprouts a straight narrow tendril.
#   Each tendril soon turns into a radial text line, reading outwards
#   (unit "R").  Some of the text is therefore upside down.
#
#   The eight sectors defined by these rays alternately contain a
#   bunch of unnamed stars, or two radial labels (unit "S"), collinear
#   and reading outwards, with a single star between them. Clockwise
#   from the division at 11:30 there are 9, 1, 8, 1, 9, 1, 9, 1 stars,
#   i.e. 35 unlabeled ones and 4 labeled ones.  The 03:00 sector (with 8
#   stars) has a speckled blotch behind and between two stars.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The small central flower may be the Sun. Or it may represent the
#   stamens/pistils of the large flower surrounding it.
#
#   The speckles in the 03:00 sector possibly represent a more distant
#   star cluster.
#
#   The radial lines should probably be read starting from 10:30, at
#   the gap in the outer text ring. Besides, that ray is the only one
#   that contains any EVA "p" (two of them).
