# Description:
#
#   One plant, flush against the right margin.
#
#     Roots: a bunch of unbranched tentacle-like roots radiating from 
#       the stem's base. Light colored, partial dark overpaint.
#     Stem: rather thick, bent. Light colored, dark overpainted stripe (shadow) along
#       its left side.
#     Branches: none.
#     Leaves: lance-shaped with an S bend, very dense, 
#       growing straight off the stem on both sides, each partially covering
#       the previous one. Stem ends with one unpaired leaf. Light colored, 
#       with a dark-painted shadow on the bottom of each leaf, and
#       a dotted line just inside the leaf's rim.
#     Flowers: none.
#
#   Four paragraphs (with 9.5, 3.5, 2.7, and 2.8 lines): a longer one
#   at the top, and three short ones just below mid-page. The first
#   two are left-justified and follow the plant's outline on the
#   right. The last two are left- and right-justified, and interrupted
#   by the main stem.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The plant looks strange because of the dense leaves Perhaps they
#   are actually the sheaths of leafstalks, badly drawn? Perhaps the
#   dots along the leaf rim are short spines?
