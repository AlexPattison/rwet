# AN INTERLINEAR ARCHIVE OF VOYNICH MANUSCRIPT TRANSCRIPTIONS IN EVA
# ==================================================================
#
# OVERVIEW
#
# Edited by J. Stolfi
# Release 1.6e6 - ?? Dec 1998
#
# This file was derived mainly from 
#
#   INTERLN.EVT file version 1.6, by Gabriel Landini (27 Sep 1996)
#
#   Partial transcriptions by John Grove, posted to the Voynich mailing list.
#
#   Partial transcriptions by Jorge Stolfi.
#
#   A COMPLETE transcription by Takeshi Takahashi (25 Nov 1998).
#
# The bulk of the text taken from INTERLN.EVT consisted of the
# historical (punchcard) transcriptions by W. Friedman, M. D'Imperio,
# C. Currier, and others, re-typed, edited and published by Jim Reeds,
# Jim Guillogly and Jacques Guy. See sections <f0.I> and <f0.J> for more
# details.
#
# The version by T. Takahashi was fetched from his site on 25 Nov
# 1998. It is the first complete transcription of the VMS, and the
# only one in this file that uses the full EVA encoding (including
# "weirdos").
#
# Extensive edits were made to the above files by J. Stolfi, mostly
# affecting comments, line and paragraph breaks, and line numbering.
# Here is a quick summary:
#
#   Split into separate files (one per textual unit).
#
#   Added "text unit" codes (usually ".P") to main text lines.
#
#   Mapped to the EVA encoding.
#
#   Unfolded  '[|]' choices into separate lines.
#
#   Added many new transcriptions and comments.
#
#   Corrected many line-breaking errors in the interlinear file.
#
#   Abolished the "astro"/"cosmo" distinction; it is all "cosmo" now.
#
#   Added unit header lines "<fNNN.UU> {...}" besides page headers.
#
# On the other hand, no text characters or word breaks were
# (consciously) changed. More details about the edits can be found in
# the other parts of this introduction (sections <f0.*>).
