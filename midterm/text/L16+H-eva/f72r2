# Description:
#
#   Three concentric rings of text, bounded by faint mechanically drawn
#   circles. A short radial stroke at 10:30 in the inner ring may be the 
#   starting place.
#
#   In the centre there are two human figures, apparently a man and a woman,
#   holding each other hands---left in left, below, and right in right, above.
#   The man wears a wide hat, a shirt with long narrow sleeves,
#   ring collar, simple belt, a skirt with trimmed edge reaching below the knee, 
#   and boots.  The woman wears an elaborate draped dress, with ring collar,
#   broad sleeves with wrist bands, a small bonnet with long hair or a veil 
#   hanging down her back, and a skirt that drags on the floor.  Between
#   the two figures is a word in the latin alphabet (``Jony'' according to 
#   Robert Firth.
#
#   Between the inner ring of text and the middle ring are 9 naked
#   human figures or "nymphs", all female, each standing with the
#   right hand on her hip, holding a star with her left.
#
#   Between the middle ring and the outer ring there are 16 nymphs,
#   standing, each holding a star with the left hand. Four are clothed,
#   the rest is naked. Most are definitely women (with visible breasts);
#   the rest are probably women, or could be. Three of the figures two
#   of them clothed) are standing on top of horizontal cylinders,
#   resembling the ones on f70v2. Usualy the right hand is resting on
#   the hip, but in a couple of cases the right arm is drooping by the
#   victim's side, or straight down and back, and one figure (at 04:00)
#   has the arms streched out horizontally.
#
#   Standing on top of the diagram, outside the text circle, are another 5
#   naked women, right hand on the hip, each holding a star.
#
#   All figures are drawn in 3/4 view, between frontal and clockwise-facing.
#   Some of the figures are walking. Some of the figures have hats.
#
#   Clockwise from each figure there is a short label.

# Comments:
#
#   The sign of Gemini, the Twins, has sometimes been represented by a 
#   man and woman. Gemini is ??? to ???.
