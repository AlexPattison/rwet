# Description:
#
#   The page contains a circular diagram surmounted by a paragraph
#   with 3.5 lines (unit "P"). 
#
#   The diagram consists of a faint circular outline filled with 
#   29 randomly placed stars, each with a label (unit "S"). 
#
#   At the top and bottom of the diagram, just inside the outline, there
#   are two smaller circular medallions.
#
#   The top medallion (the Sun) sports a ring of fang-shaped rays.
#   Inside it is the face of a woman, with short curly hair and
#   crossed eyes; and three voynichese words (unit "X").
#
#   The bottom medallion is framed by a circular band with some text
#   (unit "Y"). Inside the frame is the face of a man(?), also with
#   crossed eyes, apparently with short hair and a "frame" beard, both
#   dark.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The two medallions presumably represent the Sun and Moon. Compare
#   this diagram with the following one (f68r2), which is visible at
#   the right when the foldout is open.
