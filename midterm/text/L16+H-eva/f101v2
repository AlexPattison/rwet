#   This page spans two normal-size panels (f101v2 and f101v1) in a
#   four-panel fold-out folio. They were originally entered as two
#   separate pages (f101v2 and f101v1). However the text and plants
#   clearly connect across the joining fold. [Stolfi]

#
# Description:
#
#   The top 2/3 of the page contain three rows of plants, with 9, 9,
#   and 10 plants, respectively. The fold between the two panels falls
#   to the right of plants [1.4] and [2.4], and cuts through plant
#   [1.5].
#   
#   In rows 1 and 2, each plant has a one-word label (units "R1" and
#   "R2"), at its right or above, except perhaps for plant [1,7]. The
#   plants in row 3 are unlabeled.
#     
#   There are also three containers crammed into the left margin of
#   the page (panel v2 only), next to each row of plants. No labels
#   are visible on them (but the image is too dark to tell for sure).
#   All three containers have a simple cylindrical shape. They are
#   dark painted, undecorated except for a few narrow rings, light
#   colored, some of them with dots. The relative ring positions, from
#   the bottom, are: 0.0, 0.7, 1.0 (top container); 0.0, 0.3, 0.8, 1.0
#   (middle), and 0.0, 0.8, 1.0 (bottom).
# 
#   Below the plants are three paragraphs, with 2.7, 2.8, and 3.0 lines
#   (unit "P"). The first two lines of the paragraph 1 are interrupted
#   by the roots of plants [3,8] and [3,9].
#
#   Below the last paragraph there is a centered partial line or "title"
#   (unit "T").  It may be simply the last line of paragraph 3.
#
#   Plant descriptions:
#
#     ROW 1:
#     
#       1 headroot, bugroot, bird or crab?root [John Grove]
#  
#       [1,1] Root: two thick horizontal roots; the left one seems truncated,
#         the right one makes an S-curve, and tapers down to a blunt point.
#         Stem: vertical and unbranched. Leaves: rounded, with five
#         big dents and many smaller ones (like a coarse circular saw blade);
#         with long stalks, paired except for a lone leaf at top. (May be flowers?). 
#  
#       [1,2] Root: fat knobby carrot. Stem: vertical, unbranched. Leaves:
#         trowel-shaped, drooping, no stalks, toothed edges.  Flower:
#         one, large, horizontal; the image is too dark to see any detail.
#  
#       [1,3] Root: rather peculiar---the base of the stem bifurcates 
#         like an inverted "U", and each arm ends with a "fat carrot",
#         barely wider than it. The arms of the "U" are thicker than the
#         stem and almost as thick as the "carrots"). Stem: vertical,
#         with two paired horizontal branches. Leaves: quite strange, look like
#         ice-cream cones with thick walls, inserted upside-down on the
#         leaf stalks.
#  
#       [1,4] Root: begins like a small carrot but immediately splits 
#         into three tapering and diverging rootlets. Stem: vertical,
#         with two paired horizontal branches. Leaves: on medium-length
#         stalks, paired (except for lone leaf at top), triangular, with
#         two round lobes and two "horns" on the long sides, near the
#         base. (Each leaf resembles a toy "space shuttle" with two
#         pairs of wings).
#  
#       [1,5] This plant is barely visible in the source image, but part
#         of it can be seen in the reproduction of page f101v2. Root:
#         dense round mass, perhaps a spiny tuber. Stem: unbranched,
#         vertical. Leaves: two, oblong, paired, at end of stem.
#         
#       [1,6] Root: "fat crossed legs". Stem: vertical, unbranched.
#         Leaves: paired, triangular, with somewhat drooping stalks.
#         
#       [1,7] Root: "lock of hair".  Stem: vertical, unbranched.
#         Leaves: paired, broad, lance-shaped, with slightly dented edges,
#         pointing fully down.
#         
#       [1,8] Root: two horizontal, diverging,tapering branches. Stem:
#         vertical, unbranched, slightly curved.  Leaves: maize-like,
#         without stems, curved down.  The leaves are partly obscured
#         by bleedtrough from the leaves of f101r1[1,2]
#         
#       [1,9] Root: four horizontal branches, two on either side;
#         the bottom ones are shorter and curved inwards, like 
#         crab's claws. Stem: vertical, unbranched.  Leaves:
#         oval, ending with a point, with short stems; paired and
#         perpendicular to the stem, except for a single leaf at the
#         top.
#
#     ROW 2:
#       
#       [2,1] Looks like a single leaf, without root or stem.
#         The leaf is round, dark, with scalloped edges. In the center
#         of the top side there is a light "C", with the opening pointing SE;
#         the stalk is apparently attached to the underside, roughly at
#         the center of the "C".
#        
#       [2,2] Root: with two horizontal branches, dark and thickened,
#         with downturned tips and many down-pointing hairs (like a thick
#         moustache that needs to be trimmed.)  Stem: straight, pointing NE,
#         with two paired branches that start horiontal but curve up
#         (the whole resembles a three-armed candelabrum). Leaves:
#         three flyswatter-like leaves (or dense leaf clusters) with 
#         toothed distal edge.
#        
#       [2,3] Root: a tilde-shaped main root, almost horizontal,
#         pointing W, with 7 short, tapering, curved rootlets (like bird's claws).
#         Stem: vertical, unbranched.  Leaves: a big round leaf, with toothed edge,
#         and a wide slice missing at the bottom part (where the stem is
#         connected to the leaf center). Alternatively it could be
#         a fan-like cluster of tightly packed, long and narrow leaves.
# 
#        
#       [2,4] Root: it has two horizontal branches, smooth, tapered
#         and slightly curved, each having a roundish "hump" where it
#         gets near the stem. It also has a "fat mousetail" stretching
#         down from the base of the stem and gradually curving towards
#         West. Stem: vertical, somewhat curved, unbranched. Leaves (or
#         flowers): light-colored, two paired, three alternate, a single
#         one at the end of the stem; all with long slightly crooked
#         stalks. Each leaf is a star with 8 to 10 sharp triangular
#         rays, with a dot at the center.
#  
#       [2,5] Root: two short worm-like branches, bent horizontally to the left.
#         Stem: practically none. Leaves: Large, round, with round-toothed
#         edges, coneccted directly to the root by thin mostly upright 
#         stalks.  The leaves were painted in alternating lightand dark tones.
#         (The "leaves" could also be leaf clusters, and the "stalks" could be
#         branches.) 
#         
#       [2,6] Root: a small knobby carrot, dark, pointing to the right.
#         Stem: several twisted branches rising from the root. Leaves:
#         round, with large round teeth, with stems resembling the branches.
#         
#       [2,7] Root: very small, basically six short strokes pointing 
#         to the sides and down.  Stem: practically null.  Leaves:
#         two, paddle-shaped, paired.
#         
#       [2,8] Root: long and thin, unbranched, worm-like, growing
#         almost horizontally to the left, ending with a single whisker.
#         Stem: short and upright. Leaves: only one, growing up from
#         the top of the stem; broad, eye-shaped, with many peg-like
#         teeth.  
#         
#       [2,9] Root: a short knobby carrot, growing horizontally
#         to the left.  Stem: none. Leaves: broad, lance-shaped,
#         undulating, with a medium-length stalk, attached directly to the root.
#       
#     ROW 3:
#       
#       [3,1] Root: a small bulbous tuber, bent W (like a small 
#         eggplant), ending with a short rootlet. Stem: vertical,
#         unbranched.  Leaves: eigth paired, one at the top; feather-like
#         with many sharp leaflets, resembling the branches of a pine
#         tree. (The image is too dark to tell for sure).
#           
#       [3,2] Root: a dense brush of short S-shaped rootlets, with a 
#         single long mousetail stretching out in the SW direction. Stem: verrtical,
#         unbranched, slightly curved NW at the top. Leaves: triangular, 
#         with slightly serrated edges, narrow but stiff, horizontal, paired,
#         with medium-short stalks.  Flower(?): a large one at the top of the
#         stem, resembling a sunflower, apparently without petals. (That part
#         of the image is obscured by a blot or bleedthrough.)
#        
#       [3,3] Root: four straight spines, narrow and sharp, pointing 
#         SW.  Stem: vertical, short, unbranched. Leaves: a single
#         broad fan-shaped cluster, resembling the tail of a turkey.
#         Each leaf is long with a rounded tip, slightly curved
#         upwards.  Flowers(?): two, with long stalks branching out 
#         diagonally from mid-stem and extending above the leaf cluster.
#         The chalyx(?) looks like a flat round saucer; the 
#         corolla is cylindrical, with scalloped upper edge. 
#         (Details are hard to see in the image.)
#        
#       [3,4] Root: shaped like a fat comma, with a human face
#         on the round part, and a couple of whiskers extending
#         Westward from the tip. Stem: straight, with two
#         nearly horizontal short branches, paired.  Leaves:
#         seven, irregularly placed, with medium-short stalks.
#         Each leaf is wider than its length, with 4-5 rounded 
#         lobes on the distal edge (vaguely like the outline of 
#         a Chinese pot-sticker). 
# 
#       [3,5] (This plant is largely obscured by the fold between
#         panels v2 and v1.)  Root: only one tip is visible, West of the 
#         fold---mostly horizontal, curved up, cylindrical, ending abruptly
#         with a hooked rootlet. Stem: apparently short and vertical. Leaves:
#         a single fan-like cluster, about 60 degrees wide, of long narrow 
#         leaves, resembling palm leaflets.
#  
#       [3,6] Root: small nondescript tuber with many hairs. Stem:
#         vertical, unbranched.  Leaves: broad, lance-shaped (almost round),
#         with a short "beak". 
#       
#       [3,7] Root: small carrot-like main root ending with three short rootlets.
#         Stem: two branches (or leaf stalks) rising from the root, one vertical, one oblique.
#         Leaves: two, each with 5 lance-shaped fingers, narrow and long,
#         fanning out from the end of the stalk, with a spread of about 60 degrees.
#         
#       [3,8] Root: twisted humpy tuber, mostly horizontal, with several
#         rootlets at the periphery. Stem: straight, unbranched. Leaves:
#         two paired, lance-shaped, with very short stalks, attached at
#         mid-stem. Flowers: a single spindle-shaped inflorescence, at the
#         tip of the stem.
#         
#       [3,9] Root: two round, light tubers, with a fringe of rootlets at the 
#         bottom. Stem: vertical, unbranched. Leaves: almond-shaped, 
#         tapering to a point; paired, except for the only one at the top. 
#         
#       [3,10] Root: a round bulb with a long, narrow, tapering root growing
#         horizontally to the right. Stem: vertical, unbranched. Leaves:
#         triangular "fans" or "spatulas" (somewhat gingko-like) broad and
#         short, paired, attached directly to the stem and coplanar with
#         it. Fruits: three dark berries with medium-length stalks and a
#         light-colored circle at the top. (The "fruits" could be
#         flowers.)

# Comments:
# 
#   As proof that panels f101v2 (this page) and f101v1
#   comprise a single logical page, note that v1 has no containers,
#   but otherwise has the same layout as v2: three rows of plants (the
#   first two labeled), and three paragraphs at the bottom. Moreover
#   the paragraphs in v2 have 3.0, 3.0, and 3.0 lines, all aligned
#   with those of v1; and the last paragraph of v2 is followed by a
#   right-justfied title---which lines up neatly with the last line of
#   v1. [Stolfi]
#
#   The source of the reproduction in O'Neill's paper is acknowledged
#   as "Through the kindness of Mrs Voynich, the owner of the Ms, Dr.
#   Petersen of this institution, possesses a photostat copy of it".
#   [Gabriel 98/Mar/07]
#
#   The position of the containers suggests they were not
#   planned from the beginning, but added after the plant drawings
#   were complete. In fact this seems to be true of the whole pharma
#   section. [Stolfi]
#
#   "Fair copies" of some of these plant drawings are found elsewhere. [Stolfi]
#   
#   Some of the plants on row 2 could be algae. [Stolfi]
#
#   Plant [1,2] strongly resembles the "sunflower" on f93r. [Stolfi]
#
#   Plant [2,4] has roots with 'knots' as if it's a tree. The leaves
#   look like chestnut's. [Rene 98/Aug/16]
#
#   The leaves and overall shape of plant [3,1] resemble those of 
#   plant f100v[3,3]. [Stolfi]
#
#   The root and face on the root of plant [3,4] are standard medieval
#   symbolism. (Presumably it means that a "good" specimen is one
#   whose shape and spots resemble a human face, just as a "good"
#   mandrake root is one that resembles a human body.) [Stolfi 98/Aug/13]
