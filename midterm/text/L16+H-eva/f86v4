#   This page comes after page 171 in Landini's file.
#
#   This is the back side of the top center panel of a 12-panel
#   fold-out. It is visible when the horizontal fold is closed but the
#   vertical fold is open. The bottom side of panel is the folio's edge.
#   The top side of the panel is the horizontal crease.

# Description:
#
#   The page contains a circular diagram, and under it a single paragraph 
#   of text (5 lines, the last one short and centered).
#
#   The diagram is framed by two faint mechanically dawn circles, and
#   four rings of text --- one betweent the two circles, the other three
#   just inside the second circle. A wide gap in all four rings at 09:00
#   suggests an obviosu starting point, confirmed by four radial strokes
#   across the first ring (that may be modern scribbles in the copy,
#   however). 
#
#   (There are other simultaneous gaps in all four rings at 01:00 and
#   05:00, so the four rings may actually be two or three paragraphs
#   side by side.)
#
#   At the center of the diagram there is an uncolored disk, bounded by
#   a mechanically drawn circle, containing a small moon---with a dark
#   crescent shadow on the left side, and a human face with neutral
#   expression on the right.
#
#   Just outside this central disk there is a wide decorated band
#   containing four small human figures. The decoration looks like a
#   perspective drawing of a flat field, bent around the inner disk with
#   the innermost edge being closer to the observer. In the "field"
#   there are five parallel rows (concentric rings) of elements, shaped
#   like tombstones with rounded top. The "tombstones" are painted in
#   various colors, and some have dots, borders, or other simple
#   decoration. In the innermost ring, which is unobstructed, the
#   elements are fused together at the base.
#
#   Between these rows of "tombstones", the field is packed with round
#   objects (which could be bushes, leaves, pebbles, bubbles, etc.).
#
#   The "tombstones" in the first four rows are packed tight, and a
#   larger "tombstone" is inserted every 3-6 standard ones. The last row
#   (outermost ring) has only small tombstones, painted with alternating
#   colors, some distance apart (with some blades of "grass" in
#   between). 
#
#   The third row of tombstones is interrupted at 11:30, 02:30, 05:30,
#   and 08:30 by four human figures. The human figures are hidden by the
#   "bushes" from the waist down. The North figure is barely visible,
#   because of a a crease in the vellum. The West and South figures are
#   female (with visible breasts), and the same may be true of the other
#   two. They wear a white dress with ring collar and broad sleeves,
#   apparently tied at the wrists. Their hair is dark but not black, and
#   is just long enough to cover the ears. The South, West, and North
#   figures have both arms spread out like a "W", with hands open; East
#   has only the left arm up, in the same position.
