# Description:
#
#   The page contains a circular diagram, under a single paragraph 
#   (unit "P") with 3.9 lines.
#
#   The diagram is bounded by a faint mechanically drawn circle. Just
#   inside it is a circular band of text (unit "C"), reading clockwise.
#   This text is divided into 16 sectors; see below for details.
#
#   Most of the area inside the diagram is occupied by a flower-like
#   figure. The core of the flower is a thin mechanically drawn
#   circle, containing a star with six narrow, pointed arms. Each arm
#   has three coloured bands near the point.
#
#   The rays of the star divide the interior of the circle into six
#   unequal sectors, each labeled with a Voynichese letter (unit "W").
#   There is no obvious starting place.
#
#   Surrounding the central disk is a band of text (unit "S"), with a
#   discernible gap at 10:00. Surrounding the text is another thin
#   mechanically drawn circle, slightly eccentric.
#
#   Sprouting from the second circle are 45 thin radial lines ("flower
#   stalks"), extending almost all the way to the outer text band, each
#   of them terminating in an object that looks like a shallow conical
#   cup (perhaps a stylized flower, resembling a California poppy).
#   The "flowers" touch each other, forming a continuous ring. 
#
#   The 45 sectors defined by the flower stalks are alternatingly
#   "empty" and filled with 22 radial lines of text (unit "R"),
#   reading outwards. This leaves two adjacent empty sectors at 02:00.
#   The first of these two empty sectors (going clockwise) is cut by
#   an extra radial line that passes between the two flower cups and
#   extends all the way to the outer circle. The clockwise half of
#   this sector is is decorated with abstract patterns.
#
#   Some of the "empty" sectors have a stripe of dark paint, displaced
#   to one side. There are 12 dark stripes, starting with the 3rd
#   sector after the decorated "marker", and then spaced
#
#     2,4,4,2,4,6,2,4,6,2,4
#
#   sectors apart (always clockwise).
#
#   The space between the "ring of flowers" and the outer circle is
#   divided into sixteen sectors by another set of radial lines, thin
#   and wavy. These lines divide the outer band of text into sixteen
#   phrases, each containing a few whole words. One of these lines is
#   the extra radial line at 02:00, that defined the decorated band.
#   The other fifteen lines start at the flower ring, either between
#   two adjacent flowers (13 cases) or at the middle of a flower (2
#   cases). These lines thus divide the "flower ring" too into
#   sections, which, clockwise from the "start marker" line contain
#
#     2, 2, 2.5, 3.5, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3.5, 3.5, 3, 3, 2, 3
#
#   flower cups.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The dark stripes in some sectors may have been the result of the
#   hypothetical "Dark Painter" mistaking the spaces between the
#   radial lines by solid cylinders, and tried to shade them
#   accordingly. Unfortunately that "obvious" interpretation is
#   excluded when one looks closely at how the radial lines connect to
#   the "cups".  Of course the "shadows" have made the error easier to
#   make.
#
#   There is no obvious place to start reading the letters between 
#   the star arms; but if one starts at 11:00 (the smallest sector)
#   the letters spell out "dolsedy"; which may be an unexpected
#   splitting of "dolshdy", a rather common word.
#
#   The radial lines and the outer text probably start at the
#   decorated band at 02:00. On the other hand, the decorated band may
#   be just a filler addded to patch up a mistake (the attempt to fit
#   an alternating pattern into an odd number of sectors).
