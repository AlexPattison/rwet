# Description:
#
#   One plant occupies the bottom 2/3 of the page. 
#
#     Roots: four thin stalks, arcing down, each ending with a tuber shaped like
#       a chili pepper pod. The tubers are almost horizontal, pointing outwards,
#       and resemble four feet wearing pointy shoes.
#     Stem: short and thick, dark-painted very crudely .
#     Branches: none.
#     Leaves: each leaf consists of a dense stack of parallel leaflets.
#       curled inwards.  The distal leaflets are bigger, so that the leaf
#       is shaped like a truncated cone, with the narrow end down.  
#       Very weird-looking. Alternate leaflets are dark-painted.
#       Stalks: about as long as the stem, slightly S-shaped.
#     Flowers: two, one on each side.
#       Stalks: medium long, thin, slightly curve, branching off
#       diagonally from each the leaf axilla.  Chalix: olive-shaped,
#       with short, flaring, triangular sepals; medium-dark.
#       Petals: triangular, dark.  Core: not visible.
#
#   Above the plant there are three paragraphs (with 4.6, 2.8, 4.9
#   lines, respectively), flush with the top, left, and right margins.
#   The last line is interrupted by the plant.
#   
#   There is a faint scribbling to the left of the root. It looks like
#   an illegible word surmounted by a large EVA "l", followed by a very
#   crude stick man with rectangular head and eyes, wearing two
#   superimposed EVA "l"s as a hat.
#
#   The bottom edge of the page has an indentation, about 1cm deep
#   near the middle of the edge, extending from there to the SW corner. 
#
#   There is a mark in the SE corner, resembling "8" with superscript 
#   "ug".
#
# Comments:
#
#   The plant looks very strange and inelegant, it was very poorly
#   drawn.
#
#   Since the roots barely touch the edge of this tear, without
#   crossing it, we can presume that the the defect was already there
#   when the plant was drawn..
#
#   The mark in the SE corner is almost surely the quire number, "8th"
#   in abbreviated Latin.
