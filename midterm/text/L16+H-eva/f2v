# Description:
#
#   One plant centered on page. 
#
#     Root: long straight rhizome, covered with scales or round stalk scars.
#     Stem: single, vertical, slightly bent, shooting out from middle 
#       of rhizome; dark painted. 
#     Branches: there is the stub of a lost branch at mid-stalk.
#     Leaves: a single large leaf, horizontal, shaped like a very fat C,
#       with smooth rim. Painted solid dark.
#       Stalk: short.
#     Flowers: one white flower, pointing almost straight up.
#       Stalk: long, light colored, with a darker vein; part of it
#       obscured by leaf which should be behind it.  Chalyx: well-drawn,
#       with thick tongue-shaped sepals, light colored.  Petals:
#       well-drawn, flaring, lily shaped, serrated edges, white
#       underpaint.  Core: not visible.  Stamen: long, with a few short
#       hairs.
#
#   Two paragraphs (with lines, respectively), left- and
#   right-justified: one at the top, interrupted by the single flower,
#   and one just below mid-page, interrupted by the main stem.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The plant looks quite natural and well-drawn.
#
#   Presumably, the flower stem was in front of the leaf in the
#   original drawing; but the dark overpaint covered it. The original
#   outline of the leaf may have been obscured, too.
#
#   The leaf shape suggests it is a water plant. With that assumption,
#   the choices are quite few. Rene suggested
#
#     Nymphaea candida (a.k.a. Nymphaea alba; water lily, seerose)
