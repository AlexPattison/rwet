# Description:
#
#   [To be checked and completed]
#
#   Three concentric rings of text, deimited by six faint mechanically
#   drawn circles. The outer and inner rings have wider word gaps 
#   at 08:45. (The middle ring crosses a fold at that point).
#
#   In the centre is an animal resembling a lioness, facing west. The
#   animal has a very short and sparse mane, and a long tail ending in
#   a tuft of hair. The tail curved down, between or behind the rear
#   legs, then up behind body, and then forward. The right front paw
#   is lifted and points West. The animal has a muzzle similar to that
#   of the nibbling animal in f???, and is showing a longish, narrow,
#   pointed tongue.
#
#   Below the lion is a non-Voynichese word, possibly "augst" in
#   lowercase Latin letters. There may be a dot over the first leg of
#   the "u". The "s" looks like an uncrossed "f" with a straight
#   descender. The "t" looks like an EVA "c".
#
#   The three rings of text define two bands containing human figures
#   (12 in the inner band, 18 in the outer one), all naked, in 3/4
#   view (between frontal and facing clockwise). Each figure holds a
#   star with the left hand. The right hand is generally on the hip.
#
#   All the figures are naked. Most have visible breasts and 
#   shoulder-long hair.
#
#   Clockwise from each figure there is a short label.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The animal at the center is probably a lion, the astrological
#   symbol for Leo. Leo is ??? to ???.
