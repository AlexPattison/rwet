#
#   Root: a very broad tuber, like a fat pancake with a mostly light
#     upper surface and dark edge.  The "pancake" is slightly bent with
#     left and right edges higher than the middle. A ring of 15 "fat
#     mousetail" roots --- dark, short and S-shaped --- sprout from the
#     edge; they seem to support the "pancake" like the legs of a
#     table. The three ones in front are much thicker than the 12 in the
#     back.  (Note that if the thick roots were split in two, there will
#     be 18 roots, close to the 19 of f39r.)
#   Stem: many short straight stems sprout separately from the top surface
#     of the "pancake". Each stem ends with a leaf and flower; the
#     longer ones have additional leaves attached to them.
#   Branches: occasional short branches, each having a 
#     single leaf and flower at the tip.
#   Leaves: two spindle-shaped leaves fused at the base, forming a 
#     "V" with fat arms and pointed tips.  No leaf stalks.
#   Flowers: one per branch.
#     Stalk: longish.  Chalyx: spindle-shaped, with smooth rim.  Petals
#     and core: none.
#
#   An almost identical copy of this drawing appears on f39r. This one
#   is drawn with less skill and/or care. The root shape is more
#   irregular, its top surface is medium dark, and the flowers have only
#   a flat circle in place of the corolla and core.
#   Also the flowers sprout from the tip of each stem or branch.
