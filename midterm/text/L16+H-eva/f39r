# Description:
#
#   One plant flush against the left, right and bottom edges of the page, 
#   filling the bottom half of the page.
#
#     Root: a very broad tuber, like a fat pancake with flat light
#       upper surface and dark edge.  A ring of 19 "fat mousetail" roots---
#       dark, short and S-shaped---sprout from the edge; they seem
#       to support the "pancake" like the legs of a table.
#     Stem: many short straight stems sprout separately from the top surface
#       of the "pancake". Each stem ends with a leaf.
#     Branches: occasional short branches, each having a 
#       single leaf at the tip.
#     Leaves: two spindle-shaped leaves fused at the base, forming a 
#       "V" with fat arms and pointed tips.  No leaf stalks.
#     Flowers: a single flower.
#       Stalk: longish.  Chalyx: spindle-shaped, with small triangular
#       sepals.  Petals: seven small scale-shaped petals.  Core: small.
#
#   There are three paragraphs of text (with 4.3, 3.4, 5.9 lines)
#   above the plant, flush against the top margin. Below the third one
#   there is a centered line with 4-5 words; it may be part of the
#   paragraph. The first two paragraphs span margin-to-margin; the
#   last one is even on the left, and extends right up to the plant's
#   outline on the right, even touching it.

# Comments:
#
#   An almost identical copy of this drawing appears on f95r2. The
#   drawing on this page is drawn with more skill, and the flowers are
#   more detailed. The root is flatter, and its upper surface is
#   ligher. Also the flowers sprout from the side of the stem, not
#   from its tip as in f95r2.
